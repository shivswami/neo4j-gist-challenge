Mark Needham - via an interesting http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2013/11/29/neo4j-modelling-series-of-events[blogpost] -
made me go back to finish my pondering on how to model an ordered container. By which I basically mean an ordered list in a graph.
Trimming down what he describes to the problem of containment and order, I use the example of songs that 
are part of an album and part of a playlist, both of which are ordered. Actually, I was modeling that anyway.
So just doing the old _NEXT_ relationships on songs to order them won't work, since the unanswered question would 
be "who's _NEXT_ is it anyway?". The album's, the playlist's? Or from another container that will be added in the future? 

But why should the _NEXT_ relationship go on the song in the first place? The song doesn't care. Both the containment and 
the order are concerns of the album and playlist - the containers. So let them handle it. But how? Have _HAS_ relationships from
the container to the songs with _position_ properties on the relationships? Awkward and not very pretty to query. Nor very graphy.
So the position can't be on the song node and it can't be in the relationship ... guess we need more nodes! Let's extract the 
ordering into separate nodes:

== Variant 1

We can now fetch all songs, properly ordered, by traversing from the container via the _FIRST_ relationship, continue
with the _NEXT_ relationship to obtain all _items_ and finally, via the _VALUE_ relationship we can fetch the ordered
songs.

=== Retrieve all songs of the album, ordered
[source,cypher]

MATCH (n:Album)-[:FIRST]->(first)-[:NEXT*0..]->(item)-[:VALUE]->(song) 
RETURN song.name

//table

This is however cumbersome if - for different queries - all you want are the songs, disregarding ordering, which should 
be easy to achieve.

== Variant 2

This adds _HAS_ relationships so that traversing all outgoing _HAS_ and then all _VALUE_ relationships returns the songs.
But still this makes it necessary to be aware of ordering when all that is wanted is to get the songs.

== Variant 3

The _HAS_ relationship now runs from the container directly to the songs. This is a surprisingly elegant solution that 
evolved, as now containment and ordering are separated. Queries for containment are now a simple _HAS_ relationship away,
while fetching the songs in an ordered fashion is still possible like done in Variant 1. 

= Nesting

Let's have  'container in a container' example using the good old Dr. Who series. First the usual node with _HAS_ relationships
 - the containment part. Simple and pretty standard.

Now let's add ordering. Note how the _NEXT_ relationships are unambiguous now, without any _position_ property tricks:

The nice thing is that it is simply added to an existing structure, so this is a way to evolve your graph if ordering becomes a 
requirement. Also, your existing queries will continue to work without modification.

= Summary

Now there are songs, which can be part of anything, without having to care about it (but being able to query all 
incoming _VALUE_ relationships to determine which containers a song is part of) while the _NEXT_ relationships are
unambiguous now. There are also the containers taking care of containment, and there are the (optional) ordering nodes. 
All cleanly separated and relatively easily queryable.  

See the http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/milestone/cypherdoc-linked-lists.html[manual] for examples on working with Cypher on
linked lists (which the ordering nodes are).

I'm not sure about the naming, esp. the relationship names, e.g. would _CONTAINS_ be better than _HAS_, and would _ORDER_ be
clearer than _FIRST_? What do you think?

P.S. I think I'll just discard the idea of picking up blogging again and I'll just create GraphGists instead - this is more fun! :-)
