Mark Needham - via an interesting http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2013/11/29/neo4j-modelling-series-of-events[blogpost] -
made me go back to finish my pondering on how to model an ordered container. By which I basically mean an ordered list in a graph.
Trimming down what he describes to the problem of containment and order, I use the example of songs that 
are part of an album and part of a playlist, both of which are ordered. Actually, I was modeling that anyway.
So just doing the old _NEXT_ relationships on songs won't work, since the unanswered question would be "who's _NEXT_ is it anyway?".

But why should the _NEXT_ relationship go on the song in the first place? The song doesn't care. Both the containment and 
the order are concerns of the album and playlist - the container. So let them handle it. But how? Have _CONTAINS_ relationships from
the container to the songs with _position_ properties on the relationships? Awkward and not very pretty to query. So the position, 
can't be on the song node and it can't be in the relationship ... guess we need more nodes! Let's extract the ordering into 
separate nodes:

== Variant 1

We can now fetch all songs, properly ordered, by traversing from the container via the _FIRST_ relationship, continue
with the _NEXT_ relationship to obtain all _items_ and finally, via the _VALUE_ relationship we can fetch the ordered
songs.
This is however cumbersome if all you want are the songs, disregarding ordering, which should be easy to achieve.

== Variant 2

This adds _HAS_ relationships so that traversing all outgoing _HAS_ and then all _VALUE_ relationships returns the songs.
But still this makes it necessary to be aware of ordering when all that is wanted is to get the songs.

== Variant 3

The _HAS_ relationship now runs from the container directly to the songs. This is a surprisingly elegant solution that 
evolved, as now containment and ordering are separated. Queries for containment are now a simple _HAS_ relationship away,
while fetching the songs in an ordered fashion is still possible like done in Variant 1. 

= Nesting

Let's have  'container in a container' example using the good old Dr. Who series. First the usual node with _HAS_ relationships
 - the containment part. Simple and pretty standard.

Now let's add ordering.

The nice thing is that it is simply added to an existing structure, so this is a way to evolve your graph if ordering becomes a 
requirement. Also, your existing queries will continue to work without modification.

 NOTES

The container now groups and orderes it's items, referencing the songs, which are unimpressed by all that, as they needn't now about
any containers.
This way, a collection may also itself be an item in another collection, say you have your playlists and now you turn DJ and
put your vinyl records (old school baby!) into crates. Now you create 'crate' containers which contain playlist containers. Neat. 

3 nicely separates containment and ordering, to allow to easily add ordering to an existing container if needed. As well as 
making queries for containment simple.

TODO
Queries: 
- number of items in album/pl
- get records of album/pl
- insert item => steal from manual (linked list)

TODO nice showcase for using (multiple) labels: album => Album:Container, no?

DON'T query (container)-[:FIRST*|NEXT*]-> falls if container contains another container
  does FIRST|NEXT* work? or does it have to be ()-[:FIRST]-(first)-[:NEXT]-(next) return f, n => try it!

So, what do you think? 

P.S. I think I'll just discard the idea of picking up blogging again and I'll just create GraphGists instead - this is fun! :-)
