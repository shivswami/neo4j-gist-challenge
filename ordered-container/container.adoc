= Ordered Container

Mark Needham - via a http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2013/11/29/neo4j-modelling-series-of-events[blogpost] 
made me go back to finish my pondering on how to model an ordered container. By which I basically mean an ordered list in a graph.
Trimming down what he describes to the problem of containment and order, I use the example of songs that 
are part of an album and part of a playlist, both of which are ordered. Actually, I was modelling that anyway.
So just doing the old _NEXT_ relationships on songs won't work, since the unanswered question would be "who's _NEXT_ is it anyway?".

But why should the _NEXT_ relationship go on the song anyways? The song doesn't care. Both the containment and 
the order are concerns of the album and playlist - the container. So let them handle it. But how? Have _CONTAINS_ relationships 
with _position_ properties on the relationships? Awkward and not very pretty to query. So the position, can't be on the song node and 
it can't be in the relationship ... guess we need more nodes! Let's extract the ordering into separate nodes:

TODO
Queries: 
- number of items in album/pl
- get records of album/pl
- insert item => steal from manual (linked list)

... This way, a collection may also itself be an item in another collection, say you have your playlists and now you turn DJ and
put your vinyl records (old school baby!) into crates. Now you create 'crate' containers which contain playlist containers. Neat. 


TODO nice showcase for using (multiple) labels: album => Album:Container, no?

So, what do you think? 

P.S. I think I'll just discard the idea of picking up blogging again and I'll just create GraphGists instead - this is fun! :-)
